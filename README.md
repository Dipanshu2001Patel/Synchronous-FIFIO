# Verilog-Code-of-Synchronus-FIFO-Design-with-verilog-test-code
A FIFO or Queue is an array of memory commonly used in hardware to transfer transfer data between two circuits with different clocks. There are many other use of FIFO also. FIFO uses a dual port memory and there will be two pointers to point read and write addresses. Here is a generalized block diagram of FIFO.
